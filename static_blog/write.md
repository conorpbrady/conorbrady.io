## Write

Write more. Get everything that is in your head out of your head

Practice the art of written communication - not just how you arrange the words on the page,
but to get the flow of ideas of out my brain and on to the page.

Current approach is to allow as best I can a stream of consciousness, don't worry about
punctuation grammer etc, just get it all down on the page and worry about the edit later.

Not only is this a way in for others to see my thoughts and feelings, but it's a way to clock
my own feelings and thoughts. How did I feel in 2015? I only have an inkling of an idea, but looking back on
cringe worthy things I've put onto the internet from 2004, I can look back and see my growth and
how I've become a much better person (I hope)

I need to hold myself accountable to write daily
a) to journal - get my thoughts out of my head and onto paper
b) for projects / work - to become a better written communicator and build the habit
of opening my laptop and getting complex ideas out and explained simply
c) To promote myself, I have a unique perspective and way of thinking -
this is the hardest part, but I need to be more persuausive in my writing
